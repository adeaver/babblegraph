In numbers – how worrying is Greece's rise in Covid-19 cases?

Greece















A
s Covid cases surge across Europe, Greece's tally is increasing too. For those who've booked for a half-term holiday, the outlook is bleak: the nation is fast-approaching the UK's quarantine threshold figure. 


Of course, Britain already has a rather complex approach to travel restrictions in Greece: the entire country has been added to Scotland's quarantine list, while those returning to Wales from eight islands (including Zante) are required to self-isolate. There are seven Greek islands on England's quarantine list.


However, as cases rise on the mainland, those on islands are falling – leading to speculation that some could actually receive an 'island corridor' with the UK. So, how worried should you really be about your holiday? Let's take a look at the latest figures.


How many coronavirus cases does Greece currently have?


Since the pandemic began, Greece has reported 18,123 coronavirus cases. In recent weeks, the rate has increased faster than ever before – though, of course, testing has too. But, across the country, new daily cases have regularly exceeded 300 throughout September. Back in July after a strict early nationwide lockdown, positive tests rarely reached 50 per day. 


On September 29, Greece reported 416 new infections – the second-highest daily number that the country has ever recorded.

As for the all-important quarantine threshold figure, Greece is currently reporting a seven-day count of 19.6 cases per 100,000 population. In recent weeks, that figure has risen from 12.5 (September 3–9) and 18.2 (September 10–16).


Will UK travellers now have to quarantine when they return from Greece?


Travellers from Scotland must quarantine for 14 days on return from Greece, and those arriving in Wales from Mykonos, Zakynthos, Lesbos, Paros, Antiparos, Santorini, Serifos and Tinos are required to self-isolate for two weeks.


Holidaymakers returning to England need to quarantine if travelling from Crete, Lesvos, Mykonos, Santorini, Serifos, Tinos and Zakynthos.


The UK Government removes a country’s ‘travel corridor’ status – and enforces quarantine measures for returning travellers – if its cases exceed 20 per 100,000 people. Greece currently has an average of 19.6 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to September 30.


All travellers entering Greece by any land border are required to produce a negative PCR test conducted in the country of departure within 72 hours of arrival.


How does that compare to other countries?


Let’s assess the current number of infections per 100,000 people. Greece's current average of 19.6 puts it far lower then the 
UK
, which is recording 60.7. It is also lower than 
France 
(120), 
United Arab Emirates 
(67.4), and 
Portugal 
(46.9). 
Germany 
is currently at 15.7 cases, and 
Italy 
is at 19.6. 


Which areas of Greece are seeing spikes?


There is a huge disparity between regional numbers. Attica, which encompasses Athens, accounts for the vast majority of positive cases, while many are also being picked up at ports and airports.


Let's look at the daily data from September 29: 240 cases were in Attica; 61 were recorded among arriving visitors; and the remaining 115 were spread across other regions and islands. Crete recorded one case, Zakynthos (Zante) recorded three, and Samos 18.
A number of local lockdowns are in place across the country – in Athens, Pella, Pieria, Imathia and Kilkis, as well as the islands of Mykonos, Corfu, Rhodes, Lesbos, Zakynthos and Crete. These include curfews, restrictions on mass gatherings, and compulsory face masks in some public areas. For full details of the restrictions across Greece and its islands, see 
gov.co.uk
. 


How many people have died in Greece from Covid-19?


The country has reported a total of 388 deaths from Covid-19, or 37 per one million citizens. In total, 9,989 people are reported to have fully recovered from Covid-19 in Greece, with others still experiencing symptoms or undergoing treatment. 


This death rate is low. By comparison, taking into account population sizes, Spain has had 674 deaths per one million residents; the UK has had 632 per 1m; and Italy 594 per 1m.
