Australia’s largest digital publisher worked with us and featured partner XWP to consolidate 90+ brands across 15 sites on WordPress VIP.

		
“In the past, if a website wasn’t meeting its goals, the marketing campaign would be over before the team was able to make any improvements. Now, changes like this happen instantly. It’s a new world for us.”
The media powerhouse behind 22 brands including Variety, Deadline, and WWD maximizes code reuse and efficiency on VIP, building an ever-growing code library, tool set, and playbook across their publications.
